					<h4>Goal of the game</h4>
					<p>The objective of the game is to eat a specific number of fruits before your opponent to win (20 for the current version).</p>
					<h4>Character stats</h4>
					<p>Each character has 5 stats to take into consideration when planning your moves:</p>
					<p>Maximum Action Points(AP): This determines the maximum amount of AP this character can have stored at any one time.
						Any regenerated AP that exceeds this limit will be lost.</p>
					<p>Current AP: Determines the number of squares the character can move this turn.</p>
					<p>AP Regeneration: Determines the number of AP that will be added (or subtracted!) to the character's current AP at the start of the player's turn.</p>
					<p>Level: Increases as the character eats more fruits. Every level gained increases maximum AP by 1, and every 3 levels gained increases regeneration by 1.</p>
					<p>Digestion Penalty: A penalty applied to the character's AP regeneration if it eats a fruit that is not ripe yet.
						This penalty drops by 1 at the start of the player's turn, and cannot go below 0.</p>
					<h4>Fruits</h4>
					<p>Fruits are the main objective of this game. Each fruit consumed by a character increases its level by 1, and brings the team closer to their quota.</p>
					<p>Initially, only one fruit will be in play at any time. A new fruit will be spawned whenever an existing one is consumed.</p>
					<p>Additionally, an additional fruit will be placed on the field every 10 turns, 
						and the maximum digestion penalty for a spawned fruit increases as more fruits are consumed.</p>
