		<h2>Controls</h2>
		<p>When no character is selected, clicking on a character that belongs to your team will select the character if it has AP remaining.</p>
		<p>A character can be deselected by clicking outside of the character's movement distance.</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h2>Characters</h2>
		<p>A character initially begins with an Action Point(AP) capacity of 6 and an AP regeneration of 5 per turn.</p>
		<p>A player may opt to end the turn without expending all of the AP on a character, thereby allowing more AP to be available on the next turn.</p>
		<p>However, any AP that exceeds the maximum capacity will be lost.</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h2>Leveling</h2>
		<p>As you eat fruits, your level increases.</p>
		<p>Every level gained increases your maximum AP(AP) by 1.</p>
		<p>Every 3 levels gained increases your AP regeneration by 1.</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h2>Fruit Spawning</h2>
		<p>When a fruit is eaten, a new fruit will immediately be spawned.</p>
		<p>The fruit will not be spawned on a square that is currently occupied by a character, or another fruit.</p>
		<p>Additionally, for every 10 turns elapsed, an additional fruit will be present on the playing field.</p>
		<p>The maximum digestion penalty for a fruit will also increase by 1 for every 10 fruits consumed (this total is shared by both teams).</p>
